# Whoami

I'm currently 18. I've been coding since I was really young, and I got into the cybersecurity field by learning CEH. I've learned everything self-taught by watching YouTube tutorials, reading books, articles, and posts, and most importantly, getting my hands on practical, real-world examples.  
Skills and concepts that Iâ€™ve learned and found interesting:
1. Network *(especially TCP/IP)*
2. Linux
3. Coding *(Python, C/C++)*
4. Web Application Security

I've been focusing on Web Application Security for a while now because I find it much more interesting than other fields. I'm also interested in Binary Exploitation, Malware Analysis, and AI/ML Security, which I learn about in my free time.  

I'm in love with the open-source community, and I believe in **"Freedom, Privacy, and Free Learning,"** so I do my best to contribute to open-source projects regularly and also publish free learning materials. I've created many open-source tools but kept them private to improve them slowly. Now, I'm making them public one by one. My motto for my projects is **"Light, Simple, and Useful,"** so I try to code my tools with as few dependencies as possible, using raw languages to keep them simple and lightweight.  

I love watching anime and gaming *(mostly indie games)*.

I decided to share my learning journey to help the cybersecurity community, especially those who are new to this field. I share things that I'm currently learning and find helpful, such as articles, research, books, tutorials, tools, and even walkthroughs on my own projects.  
I try to keep my posts simple and helpful, and I hope they prove useful for others too! <3
