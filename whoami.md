# whoami

I'm 18, and I've been coding since I was young. I found cybersecurity interesting and it naturally drew me in. I learned everything myself by watching tutorials, reading books, articles, and posts, and most importantly, by getting hands-on practice.

My main focus is web application security. I love learning about it, researching, and occasionally working on related projects. In my free time, I also explore binary exploitation, malware analysis, and AI/ML security.

The open-source community is awesome. I believe in "Freedom, Privacy, and Free Learning," so I contribute to open-source projects regularly and share free learning materials. I've created many open-source tools that I've been improving behind the scenes. Now, I'm slowly releasing them to the public. My motto for my projects is "Light, Simple, and Useful," so I try to code them with as few dependencies as possible, using native programming languages to keep them simple and lightweight.

I love watching anime and gaming (mostly indie games).

I decided to share my learning journey to help the cybersecurity community, especially those who are new to this field. I share things that I'm currently learning and find helpful, such as articles, research, books, tutorials, tools, and even walkthroughs on my own projects.

I try to keep my posts simple and helpful, and I hope they prove useful for others too! <3
